# project-1 - PUBG2d

#### It is a topdown 2d game with pllayer on each side. There will be pickable items that will make shooting possible. Each player will have 100hp. 1 shoot will take 10hp.

## For this project we will use:

- HTML canvas.
- Javascript.
- CSS - just a little bit.

#### Game works in browser without any server.

## Creating classes.

#### This was quite challangine to understand how classes work and what they do. I had to look up a lot of things to understand how to use them. It was tricky to understand how to use them in the game project.

## Creating animation for bullets so the browser doesn't crush.

#### At on point it was very easy. I just limited number of bullets that could be created in bullet array.

## Problems along the way.

#### The code at some point got to big and confusing. I had to start over to make it easier to work with. The thing is that creating a game or OOP project for the first time without any expirience is a hard thing to do. I had to start over at one point when the code wasnt Object Oriented and started to be more Function Oriented - actually mixture of both which made it hard to make it simple.

#### After creating basic game logic like player movement, creating bullets, players collision with walls, bullets and obstacles I had high hopes for it. But after adding sprites to the game all collision broke. I had to remove obstacles from the canvas and offset characters positions to match bullets.

#### I still have to figure out how to stop the game when 1 player died but it can stop only after death animation is finished.

## What I learned.

#### Creating a game for the first time in 2 weeks is a hard thing to do. I will be working on it over longer period of time to understand and get comfortable with canvas as it is a very powerful tool which I will need for my next project.
